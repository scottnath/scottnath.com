      I am a **Frontend Architect**, which also means _{ALT_TITLES.join(', ')}_ or any other of a long list of new-hotness titles. I'm a polyglot, full-stack engineer who specializes in the front-end - which really just means I care about every User getting what they need.
      
      You can boil down what I do to four things: 

      1. I build performant and accessible UIs in whatever flavor frontend you like 
      2. I mentor and equip development teams to efficiently do the same 
      3. I build DevX that tests, prototypes and deploys
      4. I figure out how to make things work that shouldn't work
