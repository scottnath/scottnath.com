This is gonna be a brief article. In short, I changed my [robots.txt](https://scottnath.com/robots.txt) file to block AI crawlers from scraping data from my site.

On the whole, corporations are about making money. Caring about their users, or the greater public, is secondary to the needs of their shareholders gaining value. Broad brush, and that's not all corps, and really it's expected, that's business. But I don't have to give them my content. Definitely not when there is a lot of promises that AI will make me and my job obsolete.

Anywho...these articles helped my thinking on this.
